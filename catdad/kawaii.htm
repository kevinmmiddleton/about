      <!-- THE VIBE -->
      <section class="kawaii-section">
        <h2>✨ The vibe</h2>
        <p>
          It's software, not magic. And we're not curing cancer. (Though if you are — that's super serious, you guys!)
        </p>
        <p>
          I love doing great work with great people. Give me a hard problem, a team that collaborates for real, and an environment where everyone feels safe to speak up — and I'm happy.
        </p>

      <!-- HOW I WORK -->
      <section class="kawaii-section">
        <h2>🛠 How I work</h2>
        <ul class="kawaii-list">
          <li>I think out loud and talk more than you'd expect — that's the collaboration working</li>
          <li>My brain runs at 1000 mph, mostly thinking about process improvements</li>
          <li>I'll learn any tool, automate the boring stuff, fill gaps without being asked</li>
          <li>I have opinions, but I'll change my mind when you have better info</li>
          <li>I focus on real progress, not theater</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY -->
      <section class="kawaii-section kawaii-callout">
        <h2>💬 On speaking up</h2>
        <p>
          I'm not afraid to speak my mind — when I feel safe. And I want to build that same environment for you. Teams do their best work when people can say the honest thing without fear.
        </p>
        <p class="kawaii-closer">If your team has that energy, we'll get along great.</p>

          <li><strong>Blue</strong> — The lawyer. Always advocating for the group. Very professional.</li>
          <li><strong>Scarlet</strong> — Cutesy. Demure. Very mindful. The influencer of the household.</li>
          <li><strong>Luna</strong> — The baby. Part monkey, part hunter. Will do anything for sliced turkey.</li>
