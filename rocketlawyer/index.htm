                <p class="cs-section-eyebrow">Context & mission</p>
                <p class="cs-section-intro">Rocket Lawyer was entering a new phase: expanding beyond direct-to-consumer
                    and proving an enterprise distribution model across Europe. Covéa, an insurer with 11.5M customers,
                    was the first major test. What we built for this launch would determine whether Rocket Lawyer could
                    scale its legal services through partners, unlock new revenue channels, and support future deals
                    already in the pipeline. If we missed here, Rocket Lawyer’s shift into enterprise distribution would
                    stall, and future partner deals already in motion would lose momentum.</p>

                    <h3 class="cs-h3">Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Covéa's scale and complexity meant the work had to support multiple identity flows, distinct
                        brand requirements, and usage tracking at the partner level. A one-off integration wouldn't be
                        enough. We built toward a model that could support future partners, new markets, and more
                        advanced commercial structures.

                        insurance customers who previously had limited access to digital legal services.

                    The partner experience had to feel familiar, fast, and trustworthy inside a non-Rocket Lawyer
                    environment. Each moment in the flow carried real product weight. Authentication had to work without
                    friction, co-branding had to feel natural, pricing had to adjust in real time, and legal help needed
                    to stay clear and actionable. This walkthrough highlights the key interactions we shaped and why
                    they mattered for partner customers.

                <p class="cs-section-intro">Launching with a major partner required disciplined sequencing and tight coordination. I focused on unblocking engineering early, resolving dependencies ahead of time, and structuring milestones so each one supported the next. Here are the decisions that kept the build predictable.</p>

                    <h3 class="cs-h3">🎯 Scoping for Speed and Predictability</h3>
                    <p>
                        We cut anything that didn't support the partner launch and built around minimum capabilities:
                        authentication, pricing, onboarding, and partner-specific content. This kept engineering focused
                        and avoided late-stage rework.

                    <p>
                        Every architectural decision supported Covéa while keeping the path open for future partners. We
                        built the Partner Config API, defined consistent integration patterns, and isolated edge-case
                        logic so it wouldn't leak into the core product.

                    <p>
                        I worked ahead of engineering to resolve open questions with Covéa, align legal and content
                        teams, confirm pricing rules, and prepare the design system for co-branding. This let
                        engineering maintain momentum, even during partner downtime.

                                selected OpenID Connect, and created the Partner Config API. We built early partner
                                flows and established the core architecture needed for the early June authentication

                            <h3 class="cs-h3">Demos + Feedback</h3>
                            <p>Following the June authentication demo, we delivered an early preview of the broader
                                partner experience: co-branding, onboarding designs, and document access. We also built
                                the first version of the Custom Connector for Covéa, which let us support their existing
                                identity system while keeping the platform anchored to OpenID Connect for long-term
                                scalability.</p>

                            <p class="cs-challenge-date">July → August</p>
                            <h3 class="cs-h3">Working Ahead of Partner Availability</h3>
                            <p>I front-loaded decisions and closed open questions before Covéa’s August vacation. This
                                unblocked engineering to maintain steady progress while partner teams were offline.
                                During this time, we completed onboarding, pricing logic, and feature-gating controls.

                            <h3 class="cs-h3">Bringing the Experience Together</h3>
                            <p>I demoed authentication, co-branding, pricing, Ask-A-Lawyer, and partner-exclusive
                                content as a unified walkthrough. We also stabilized the Custom Connector and Config API
                                so the demo reflected the real platform, not a stitched-together prototype.

                            <h3 class="cs-h3">Technical Debt & Performance</h3>
                            <p>We prioritized a long-delayed Angular upgrade without disrupting partner deliverables.
                                Moving to ahead-of-time compilation significantly improved load times for customers in
                                France, where lower-bandwidth connections made performance a real risk. The upgrade
                                strengthened speed and stability across Rocket Lawyer’s entire EU platform, not just the
                                partner experience.</p>
