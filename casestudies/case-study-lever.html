                <h2>🚀 Introduction</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">Lever was moving upmarket. Enterprise customers expected automatic HRIS integration, self-serve data migration, and workflows that didn't break when managers were unavailable. But Lever required manual provisioning, Support-dependent candidate uploads that took days, and workarounds for basic approval flows. This friction blocked deals, frustrated IT admins, and created operational overhead. If we couldn't prove Lever could operate at enterprise scale, the upmarket expansion would stall.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="two-col">
                <div>
                    <h3>The Operational Gap</h3>
                    <p>Enterprise implementations were bottlenecked by manual data migration. Customers emailed bulk candidate files to Support, who queued uploads in Amazon S3. Turnaround time: 3-4 business days. Errors in files meant additional back-and-forth, stretching timelines to weeks.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>The Product Gap</h3>
                    <p>Enterprise customers needed Lever to work like the rest of their IT stack: automatic provisioning via SCIM, real-time sync with HRIS, and org-aware workflows. Instead, they faced manual user creation, stale data, and broken approval chains.</p>

                <p class="section-intro">We were building for multiple stakeholders across implementation, IT infrastructure, and recruiting operations, each facing different bottlenecks but all blocked by the same core issue: Lever wasn't built for enterprise scale.</p>

                <p class="section-intro">We approached Lever's upmarket challenge in two phases: first, prove we could operate efficiently at scale by eliminating implementation friction. Then, prove the product itself could integrate like enterprise infrastructure.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Phase 1: Operational Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>We started by eliminating the biggest implementation bottleneck: manual data migration. I partnered with the Top of Funnel team to build a self-serve bulk importer. Drag-and-drop CSV upload, real-time validation, specific error messages for failed rows. This cut migration time from days to minutes.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Phase 2: Platform Capabilities</h3>
                    <p>With implementation efficiency proven, we built HRIS Sync to solve the product integration gap. I built the Orion platform team from scratch (0 → 7 people) and led deep discovery with 12+ CAB customers. We anchored on SCIM as the industry standard and launched with Proxy Approval.</p>

                    <h4>Why Self-Serve First?</h4>
                    <p>Implementation bottlenecks were blocking enterprise deals immediately. Building the bulk importer delivered fast value and bought time to build the deeper HRIS Sync platform work.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Why SCIM?</h4>
                    <p>We evaluated Merge.dev but chose SCIM for long-term flexibility. Every enterprise IT stack supported it. Customers could self-implement. We retained full control.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Why Proxy Approval First?</h4>

                        <p>The Bulk Importer was built by the Top of Funnel team, not my direct reports. I had to influence without authority, shaping requirements and coordinating with implementation teams while letting them own execution.</p>

                        <p>I started HRIS Sync with no dedicated resources. I conducted deep discovery with 12+ CAB customers while simultaneously building the Orion platform team from 0 to 7 people.</p>

                        <p>SCIM was the right long-term choice for universal compatibility. Both small and large orgs can use SCIM, and it gave us full control while aligning with enterprise IT standards.</p>

                        <p>HRIS Sync was built for enterprise, but Lever served SMB too. We had to ensure features didn't add unnecessary complexity for smaller teams.</p>

                    <h3>Sequence for Quick Wins, Then Deep Capabilities</h3>
                    <p>Starting with the Bulk Importer delivered fast value and built confidence before tackling the longer HRIS Sync work. Enterprise transformation doesn't have to be all-or-nothing.</p>

                    <h3>Lead with Value, Not Compliance</h3>
                    <p>SCIM was table stakes for IT, but Proxy Approval was what recruiting teams cared about. Starting with manager approval proved HRIS Sync solved real workflow problems.</p>

                    <h3>Self-Service Unlocks Scale</h3>
                    <p>The Bulk Importer freed Support and Implementation teams for strategic work. Every workflow we could shift to self-service paid compound dividends.</p>

                    <h3>Influence Without Authority Is a Skill</h3>
                    <p>The Bulk Importer wasn't my team, but it was critical. Partnering across teams required building trust and coordinating without slowing execution.</p>
