                <h2>🚀 Introduction</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">Rocket Lawyer's Legal Documents product line was the company's core revenue engine, contributing 90% of U.S. revenue. Even small improvements to conversion rates here had outsized business impact. My mission was to find and unlock those gains through systematic A/B testing and data-driven optimization.</p>
            </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The document creation flow (where users answer questions to generate legal documents like NDAs, leases, and wills) was the primary conversion funnel. Improving gross conversion rates (GCR) here meant more users completing documents and entering the checkout flow, directly driving revenue growth.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Mission Alignment</h3>
                    <p>This work advanced Rocket Lawyer's mission to make legal services affordable and accessible. By reducing friction in the document creation experience, we helped more people successfully complete the legal tasks they came to accomplish.</p>

                <h2>🎯 The Problem</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">Conversion rates had room to grow, but the question was where to focus. Desktop vs. mobile? UX changes vs. performance improvements? We needed a systematic approach to identify the highest-leverage opportunities.</p>

                        <p>The "failed" experiment taught us something valuable: the preview builds trust in the product, shows real-time document updates, and demonstrates value before checkout. This informed future product decisions.</p>

                    <p>The desktop experiment "failed" but taught us that the preview builds trust and shows value. That insight was worth more than if we'd simply not run the test.</p>

                    <h3>Responsive ≠ Optimized</h3>
                    <p>A responsive site isn't the same as a mobile-optimized experience. Designing "frictionless" meant removing distractions and streamlining for mobile-specific constraints, not just shrinking desktop.</p>

                    <h3>Performance Is a Conversion Lever</h3>
                    <p>Site speed isn't just a technical metric. It directly impacts business outcomes. Making that relationship visible enabled targeted optimizations with measurable results.</p>
