                <h2>🚀 Introduction</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">Rocket Lawyer was entering a new phase: expanding beyond direct-to-consumer and proving an enterprise distribution model across Europe. Covéa, an insurer with 11.5M customers, was the first major test. What we built for this launch would determine whether Rocket Lawyer could scale its legal services through partners, unlock new revenue channels, and support future deals already in the pipeline.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="two-col">
                <div>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Covéa's scale and complexity meant the work had to support multiple identity flows, distinct brand requirements, and usage tracking at the partner level. A one-off integration wouldn't be enough. We built toward a model that could support future partners, new markets, and more advanced commercial structures.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Mission Alignment</h3>
                    <p>This work extended Rocket Lawyer's mission, affordable, accessible legal help, to millions of insurance customers who previously had limited access to digital legal services.</p>

                <p class="section-intro">We were building for customers who would enter Rocket Lawyer through Covéa's ecosystem. The experience needed to feel native, secure, trustworthy, and co-branded while still delivering Rocket Lawyer's full value.</p>

                        <h3>Foundations</h3>
                        <p>I ramped quickly on Rocket Lawyer's business model and platform architecture so early decisions would hold up through launch. In parallel, we defined the integration model, selected OpenID Connect, and created the Partner Config API.</p>

                        <p class="timeline-date">June → July</p>
                        <h3>Demos + Feedback</h3>
                        <p>Following the June authentication demo, we delivered an early preview of the broader partner experience: co-branding, onboarding designs, and document access. We also built the first version of the Custom Connector for Covéa.</p>

                        <h3>Working Ahead of Partner Availability</h3>
                        <p>I front-loaded decisions and closed open questions before Covéa's August vacation. This unblocked engineering to maintain steady progress while partner teams were offline.</p>

                        <h3>Bringing the Experience Together</h3>
                        <p>I demoed authentication, co-branding, pricing, Ask-A-Lawyer, and partner-exclusive content as a unified walkthrough. We also stabilized the Custom Connector and Config API.</p>

                        <h3>Technical Debt & Performance</h3>
                        <p>We prioritized a long-delayed Angular upgrade without disrupting partner deliverables. Moving to ahead-of-time compilation significantly improved load times for customers in France.</p>

                    <h3>Platform Thinking Requires Intentional Tradeoffs</h3>
