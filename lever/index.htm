                <p class="cs-section-eyebrow">Context & mission</p>
                <p class="cs-section-intro">Lever was moving upmarket. Enterprise customers expected automatic HRIS integration, self-serve data migration, and workflows that didn't break when managers were unavailable. But Lever required manual provisioning, Support-dependent candidate uploads that took days, and workarounds for basic approval flows. This friction blocked deals, frustrated IT admins, and created operational overhead for recruiting teams and Lever's own implementation staff. If we couldn't prove Lever could operate at enterprise scale, both in product capabilities and operational efficiency, the upmarket expansion would stall.</p>

                    <h3 class="cs-h3">The Operational Gap</h3>
                    <p>
                        Enterprise implementations were bottlenecked by manual data migration. Customers emailed bulk candidate files to Support, who queued uploads in Amazon S3. Turnaround time: 3-4 business days. Errors in files meant additional back-and-forth, stretching timelines to weeks. This created massive overhead for Lever's implementation team and delayed time-to-value for customers.

                <div>
                    <h3 class="cs-h3">The Product Gap</h3>
                    <p>
                        Enterprise customers needed Lever to work like the rest of their IT stack: automatic provisioning via SCIM, real-time sync with HRIS, and org-aware workflows. Instead, they faced manual user creation, stale data, and broken approval chains. IT admins provisioned users one by one. Recruiters reassigned approvals manually when managers were OOO. The gap was costing us deals.

                <p class="cs-section-eyebrow">Building for enterprise scale, not one-offs</p>
                <p class="cs-section-intro">We approached Lever's upmarket challenge in two phases: first, prove we could operate efficiently at scale by eliminating implementation friction. Then, prove the product itself could integrate like enterprise infrastructure. This sequencing let us deliver value quickly while building toward long-term platform capabilities.</p>

            <div class="cs-two-col cs-content-grid">
                <div>
                    <h3 class="cs-h3">Phase 1: Operational Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>
                        We started by eliminating the biggest implementation bottleneck: manual data migration. I partnered with the Top of Funnel team to build a self-serve bulk importer that let customers upload candidate data directly into Lever. Drag-and-drop CSV upload, real-time validation, specific error messages for failed rows. This cut migration time from days to minutes and freed implementation teams to focus on strategic onboarding.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="cs-h3">Phase 2: Platform Capabilities</h3>
                    <p>
                        With implementation efficiency proven, we built HRIS Sync to solve the product integration gap. I built the Orion platform team from scratch (0 → 7 people) and led deep discovery with 12+ CAB customers. We anchored on SCIM as the industry standard and launched with Proxy Approval—the feature that directly improved recruiting metrics. This proved Lever could integrate like the rest of the enterprise IT stack.

                    <h4 class="cs-h4">Why Self-Serve First?</h4>
                    <p>Implementation bottlenecks were blocking enterprise deals immediately. Building the bulk importer delivered fast value, proved we could execute, and bought time to build the deeper HRIS Sync platform work.</p>

                <div class="glass-card cs-content-block">
                    <h4 class="cs-h4">Why SCIM?</h4>
                    <p>We evaluated Merge.dev (faster, multi-HRIS) but chose SCIM for long-term flexibility. Every enterprise IT stack supported it. Customers could self-implement. We retained full control. Used open-source Scimmy.js to keep costs predictable.</p>

                    <p>Proxy Approval had the clearest path to measurable impact. Recruiting teams cared about Time to Hire and Time to Fill. Approval bottlenecks hurt both. Launching with manager approval proved HRIS Sync solved real workflow problems, not just compliance.</p>

                <p class="cs-section-intro">Moving Lever upmarket required partnering across teams, building new capabilities from scratch, and sequencing work to deliver value early while building for long-term scale.</p>

                    <h3 class="cs-h3">🤝 Partnering on Bulk Import</h3>
                    <p>I partnered with the Top of Funnel team to build the self-serve bulk importer. This wasn't my direct team, but the work was critical to proving Lever could operate at enterprise scale. I helped shape the product requirements, worked with implementation teams to understand edge cases, and ensured the feature integrated smoothly with existing workflows. The importer shipped first, eliminating the biggest implementation bottleneck and building confidence for the deeper HRIS Sync work.</p>

                <div class="glass-card cs-content-block">
                    <h3 class="cs-h3">🏗️ Building the Orion Team</h3>
                    <p>I started HRIS Sync with zero dedicated resources. I led discovery with 12+ CAB customers—including IT admins, TA leaders, and Lever admins—while simultaneously building the Orion platform team. By Fall 2022, we had grown to 7 people: 4 engineers, 1 designer, 1 scrum master, and me. This let us ship foundational profile updates in Winter 2022 while continuing discovery and preparing for the Spring 2023 Proxy Approval launch.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-card cs-content-block">
                    <h3 class="cs-h3">🔄 Iterating with CAB Customers</h3>
                    <p>We worked closely with 12+ CAB customers throughout HRIS Sync development, gathering feedback from IT teams and recruiting operations. This helped us understand edge cases (non-standard HRIS setups, complex org structures), validate SCIM implementation decisions, and ensure the product worked for both technical buyers (IT) and end users (recruiters). CAB feedback directly shaped our approach to error handling, user permissions, and data sync patterns.</p>

                    <h3 class="cs-h3">🎯 Prioritizing Manager Approval First</h3>
                    <p>Within HRIS Sync, Proxy Approval was the most direct path to measurable impact. Recruiting teams cared about Time to Hire and Time to Fill. Approval bottlenecks directly hurt both metrics. By launching manager approval first, we proved HRIS Sync could solve real workflow problems immediately—not just check a compliance box. This built internal momentum and customer confidence for the broader HRIS Sync roadmap.</p>

                            <p>SCIM was the right long-term choice, but it wasn't the easiest. Merge.dev offered faster time-to-market with multi-HRIS support out of the box, but it came with monthly fees, vendor lock-in, and limited flexibility. SCIM gave us full control and aligned with enterprise IT standards, but required more upfront engineering investment and self-implementation by customers. We bet on long-term scalability over short-term convenience.</p>

                            <p>HRIS Sync was built for enterprise, but Lever served SMB customers too.
